		        		I come from a non-traditional technical background. I am a B.A. candidate in American Studies, and I intend to apply for the M.S. co-terminal program in Computer Science as well. I've been
		        		exposed to many technologies in the past. I am familiar with Java, especially in the context of Android development, as well 
		        		as C++ and JavaScript. I have experience working with and figuring out various APIs as well, including Gmail and Google Drive
		        		technologies and various email marketing tools. In addition, I'm fairly well-versed in HTML and CSS — everything you see on 
		        		this page right now was made from scratch in HTML5 and CSS because I truly enjoy the flexibility it allows.
						<br><br>
						I am largely self taught. I learned jQuery for a work project last summer: building the email marketing system for <a href=https://brain-mind.org>BrainMind</a>, 
						a neuroscience non-profit devoted to creating an ecosystem of academics, venture capitalists, and industry figures to champion
						responsible and conscientious neuro-innovation. We even managed to hit an impressive 40% CTR. A month later, I was finishing a class project,
						for a communication studies course, and realized I could
						make a cool game that taught some of the concepts in the class while teaching myself React — and <a href="/~tchang97/proxemics-game">Don't Be Awkward</a>
						, a game about proxemics, was born.
						<br><br>
		        	    I am currently developing a digitized version of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) thought records that I call Headway. It 
		        	    was a good way for me to learn Android development by building a simple database-backed app while creating someting with the
						potential to help some of the millions of Americans who suffer from a psychiatric illness. It started off purely as a passion project:
						I wanted to build something for my personal use based on the mental wellness tools that I had found most effective for me. CBT was
						well-structured and understandable, so it was a natural candidate for a technological tool. Within the project, I am implementing
		        	    analytics to help users identify common emotional states and thoughts to foster emotional mindfulness and increase self-awareness
						of one's mental health, a novel method of enhancing traditional CBT via technology. Again, health is not the absence of disease — 
						I truly believe any one can benefit from a little more emotional mindfulness here and there. Demoes will be provided upon request!

		        		I'm a writer. I've always found it natural to communicate my thoughts in writing, whether I was working on a more serious article,
		        		writing stories, or composing poetry. I wanted to further that interest more in college, and so I joined the Stanford Daily, the
		        		university's student-run newspaper, in hopes of learning from my peers and improving my own craft. Due to my deep interest
		        		in electronic music and songwriting, I joined the music beat, where I was soon traveling to local concerts to cover large electronic
		        		music acts from Zedd to Porter Robinson. 
		        		
		        		<br><br>I have some experience writing as well outside the world of music. I wrote a blog post for my fellowship program in Washington D.C. the
		        		summer after my freshman year about an experience we had meeting with a lobbyist for a major telecommunications company. In addition,
		        		as editor-in-chief of my high school newspaper, I covered a plethora of topics from Asian-American identity, personal narratives, and
		        		cultural satire.

					<p>
						Music was certainly my first love. As a pianist for 15 years, I can't remember a time before I was sitting at the
						ivory keys. It was the first creative way that I discovered to express myself, and so even as a child, I grew to 
						enjoy profoundly the timeless moments of music I spent at the piano. I briefly even considered a professional career
						in the field — but I was always searching for something new, and my interest turned to other things.
						
						<br><br>Music is still certainly a part of my life. Below you will find two electronic music tracks that I produced personally
						from scratch. In addition, I am currently a taking private jazz piano lessons at Stanford University on a scholarship. 
						It's quite a refreshing experience, to go back to the instrument that I have known for the better part of my life as a 
						beginner.
